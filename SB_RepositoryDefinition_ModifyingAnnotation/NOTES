Maven project - added autoconfigure maven properties to adjust all dependencies according to spring version
Java configuration for hibernate,Db,entitymanager 

no spring data jpa repositories

EmployeeDao is a interface and this contains user defined methods(us) specific
so we are noting this as a Repository i.e(Custom Repository); 
@RepositoryDefinition(domainClass=Entity.class,idClass=Integer.class)

we write named queries in orm.xml
and the interface contains methods with @Query(namedQuery name)
positional and named parameters used in named queries


some custom methods can be determined automatically
we are not creating these using named query in orm.xml
findBYId(id)
findByName(name)
findByField(field)
save(entity)
